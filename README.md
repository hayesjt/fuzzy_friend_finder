# **Fuzzy Friend Finder - Rescue and Adoption**

##### **Project Objective:**

<p>The purpose of Fuzzy Friend Finder is to eventually pitch a newly designed website to a local shelter in hopes of becoming a volunteer software engineer team and helping them update their website, applications, and operations. Many animal shelters have websites that are outdated, not fully functioning, and they cannot afford to have a third party company continuously update their databases, information, and style. A well working and updated website is an essential tool in getting these homeless animals adopted and to their forever loving homes, we just want to take part in the process!</p>
