# Fuzzy Friend Finder - Rescue and Adoption 
###### Collaborators: Ashley Wegwerth, Haylee Thomas-Kuhlmann, Kayla Kuhlman

##### Project Objective:

    The purpose of Fuzzy Friend Finder is to eventually pitch a newly designed website to a local shelter in hopes of becoming a volunteer software engineer team and helping them update their website, applications, and operations. Many shelters have websites that are outdated, not fully functional, and cannot afford to have a company to continuously update their database, information, and style. A well working and undated website is an essential tool in getting these homeless animals adopted and to their forever loving home, we just want to be a part in that!
