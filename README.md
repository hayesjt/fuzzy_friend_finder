This application is geared toward animal rescue companies. Many times these companies get website work from volunteers or part time workers - this results in a website that doesnt aways meet the full potential it should.

I am on a mission to help the rescue I volunteer for by making a mock up of a website that goes beyond their current functionality. How do I plan on doing this?

    - Creating accounts for all volunteers that help the organization. This would include: contact info, what other events they would love to volunteer for, if they have a specialty in behavioral or disabled dogs, training taken, and so much more. Many times rescues dont know how many volunteers they have and who is the best fit for certain dogs. If they could search through their volunteers in a quick manner they could use there already scarce resources more wisely.
    - Most times the rescue will ask for specific information on a dog a volunteer is fostering. This helps that animal get adopted and with the right family. Wouldn't it be nice if the volunteer could fill out that information instead of the rescue asking and then putting it in the code? This would again save time for the rescue and the foster could provide information on the dogs.
    - Most rescues don't just have volunteers but they have people who want to adopt when they see that perfect animal they have been searching for. Adopters should have a profile too. They can file out a form with the basics of what they are looking for like age of the animal, house trained, breed, etc. and then the resuce can send them notifications when an animal meets these needs. This will help animals get adopted easier and also make it easier for adopters to find what they are looking for. Adopters also need to get a house visit before recieving the animal. If someone signs up as an adopter they could schedule a home visit right away and then get it approved on their profile once its been complete. This again can help the rescue manage their time instead of doing a ton of house visits last min. 
    - rescues run off of donations - many donations that come in are food, kennels, toys, collars, etc. But foster volunteers never know what they have until they drive and show up. Wouldnt it be nice to know what the rescue has in stock, what they need as donations, and what they are not taking at that time? Of course - this will help the rescue get the proper donations it needs and answer the questions of many volunteers. I would also like an option where people could donate their money as well - It is always nice to have back up cash if something is needed.
    - contact and about pages to make it really easy for people to get started.
    - A stats page so everyone knows how the rescue is doing.
    - Resource pages for foster dog instructions and guides. training videos, behavioral stuff, etc.
